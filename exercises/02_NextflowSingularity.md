## :bangbang: Important things to remnenber:

- Use Tab to automatically complete file names and paths, so it can be easiert to write in the terminal
- Use keyboard arrows (:arrow_up: :arrow_down:) to move through your terminal's history, so you don't have to write the commands again.
- Try not to use spaces, accents or special characters like "Ã‘" letter, when writting directory of file names.
- Basic commands you should always remember: *pwd cd ls mkdir mv rm rmdir less nano*

Go to home, just to be sure everyone is in the same folder

```bash
cd
pwd
#Output: /home/alumno
ls
```

Go to the exercise folder

```bash
cd wgs
ls
cd bacterial_wgs_training
ls
#vemos main.nf environment.yml
```

### Micromamba

micromamba is a tiny version of the mamba package manager. micromamba supports a subset of all mamba or conda commands and implements a command line interface from scratch. micromamba is a package manager that enables the installation of any type of software, in this case, bioinformatics software.

The `environment.yml` allows installing conda environments.

```bash
cat environment.yml
# We see all the software that we are going to use in the course
# With micromamba install -f environment.yml, an environment is created with everything we will need for the course
```

```bash
micromamba env list
```

```bash
fastp --help
micromamba activate fastp
#Se carga el ambiente entre parentesis delante del nombre de usuario
fastp --help
```

```bash
micromamba deactivate
```

#### How do I use Nextflow?

```bash
micromamba activate nextflow
nextflow info
```

```bash
nextflow run main.nf --help
```

So, what now? In order to execute a nextflow pipeline, we need to tell it to `run` a project which contains a `main.nf` script written in groovy + the pipeline languages:

```bash
rm results/trace.txt
nextflow run /home/$USER/wgs/bacterial_wgs_training --help
```

Optionally, we can pass a config file, and specify the .nf script inside a project:

```bash
rm results/trace.txt
nextflow -C /home/$USER/wgs/bacterial_wgs_training/nextflow.config \
run /home/$USER/wgs/bacterial_wgs_training/main.nf --help
```

Finally, let's ask how to use the pipeline:

```bash
rm results/trace.txt
nextflow run BU-ISCIII/bacterial_wgs_training -r one_week_format --help
```

There is one big detail left. The software needed to execute the pipeline is no installed in our machine. Thankfully, we have a conda environment ready for this course, and our pipeline has already being configurated to know where to find it and how to use it. Use the right argument and go for it:

```bash
rm results/trace.txt
nextflow run BU-ISCIII/bacterial_wgs_training -r one_week_format -profile conda --help
```
