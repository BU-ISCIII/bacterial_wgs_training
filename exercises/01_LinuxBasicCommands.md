### :bangbang: Important things to remnenber:
- Use Tab to automatically complete file names and paths, so it can be easiert to write in the terminal
- Use keyboard arrows (:arrow_up: :arrow_down:) to move through your terminal's history, so you don't have to write the commands again.
- Try not to use spaces, accents or special characters like "Ã‘" letter, when writting directory of file names.
- Basic commands you should always remember: *pwd cd ls mkdir mv rm rmdir less nano*

### Answering to main questions

#### How do I use the command line?

Open a terminal by clicking in the icon or typing __Ctrl+Alt+T__. Now you can type in the prompt.

#### How do I navigate the file system?

Let's remember the basics: *pwd cd ls mkdir mv rm rmdir less nano*. We are going to use those commands to:

Check our working directory:

```
pwd
#Output: /home/alumno
```

Move to our Desktop folder:

```
cd ~/Escritorio
pwd
#Output: /home/alumno/Escritorio
```
**Questions:**

- Which is the meaning of the "~" symbol?

Move to the course folder:

```
cd 
pwd
#Output: /home/alumno
cd wgs
ls
#Output: ANALYSIS  RAW  REFERENCES  RESULTS
```
**Questions:**

- What does de `cd` command withourt arguments do?
- What is the `ls` command doing?

This is the folder structure we will use for this training. Now we are going to list the files in the `REFERENCE` folder:

```
ls REFERENCES
```

This command will output a big list of files, which are the files that we will usea as REFERENCE through the different exercises of the training. Now wi will run this other command:

```
ls /home/alumno/wgs/REFERENCES/
```

**Questions:**

- Which is the difference between this las command and the previous one?
- Do they display the same information?
- Which one is relative path?
- Which one is absolute path?

Now we are going to move to the ANALYSIS folder which is the folder were we will run all the exercises

```
cd ANALYSIS
pwd
#Output: /home/alumno/wgs/ANALYSIS
ls
```
As you can see the folder is empty, so now we will fill this folder. 

Create a directory for this handson: **Remember:** Linux is case sensitive and does not like white spaces in names

```
mkdir 01-handsonLinux
```

Move to the new folder (using a relative pathway):

```
cd 01-handsonLinux
```

Check our working directory (always do it before executing something):

```
pwd
#Output: /home/alumno/wgs/ANALYSIS/01-handsonLinux
```

We are going to create a file with this course folder's tree:

```
tree /home/alumno/wgs > bacterial_wgs_training_initial.tree
```

And now we will read this file:

```
less bacterial_wgs_training_initial.tree
#Remember: To close less press "q"
```

**Questions:**
- What do you see in this file?
- What does the command `tree` do?




Create the folders "asdf", "AsDf", "ASDF" and "tmp" (at once, commands change their behavior depending on the parameters):

```
mkdir asdf AsDf ASDF tmp
```

Create a file inside "tmp" called "myFile.txt" (using a relative pathway, you can work with files outside your working directory):

```
nano tmp/myFile.txt
```

and write whatever you want and save it with __Ctrl + O__, then __Intro__ and close the new file with __Ctrl + X__

Rename "myFile.txt" to "whateverIwant" (Linux does not require file extensions):

```
mv tmp/myFile.txt tmp/whateverIwant
```

See the contents of "whateverIwant":

```
less tmp/whateverIwant
#Remember: To close less press "q"
```

Remove the file:

```
rm tmp/whateverIwant
```

Remove the folders inside "myDir" (wildcard character "\*" means "any character once or more times, or nothing"):

```
rmdir ./*
```

Go back to Desktop and remove everything you created (".." means parente directory, while "." refers to the directory itself):

```
cd ..; rm -rf myDir
```

Return to your home directory (without parameters, the behavior of the command changes):

```
cd
```

#### How do I know which software I am using?

Software may (and will) be installed in many different places. To discover the one you have loaded in your PATH use `which`, to see all the places where the shell is looking for software check the variable `$PATH`, to know the version of the software use the apropiate parameter (`-h --help -v --version`) and to check the manual of the software use `man`.

```
which git
echo $PATH
echo $USER
git -h
git --version
man git
```
